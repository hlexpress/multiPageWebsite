      <h4>Four Computer Science students went to California in 2018 to start their industrial placements. They returned to Kent a year later as stars of the international developer community, having caught Apple’s attention by launching an unofficial player for Apple Music.</h4>
      <p>Their player, Musish, had attracted 200,000 users in its first 10 months. It had been ‘starred’ 2,200 times by GitHub’s hard-to-please tech audience in the same period, and the story was picked up by specialist media around the world. This was success on a scale way beyond their expectations.</p>
      <p>But how did they do it?</p>
      <p>First, they needed to get to Silicon Valley.</p>
      <p>For the four students – James Jarvis, Raphaël Vigée, Brychan Bennett-Odlum and Filip Grebowski (l-r in photo) – the attractions of the region were obvious. It’s home to many of the world’s largest high-tech companies, plus thousands of start-ups. Naturally, it draws in a huge community of like-minded people.</p>
      <p>“For people in the tech industry, it’s the place to be,” says Filip. “So we wanted to go there and experience it.”</p>
      <p>The location and lifestyle were a big pull as well. The area is bordered by mountains and ocean and enjoys long warm summers – a recipe for fun and adventure. </p>
      <p>“I wasn’t just about work,” adds Raphaël. “It was about the whole experience, and travelling.”</p>

      <h2>Cisco placement</h2>
      <p>The students all secured placements with Cisco, thanks to the School of Computing’s strong links with the San Jose-headquartered firm. While it was up to each of the students to secure their own internship, the School supported them all the way.</p>
      <p>Filip says: “What stands out at Kent is how the School of Computing manages everything to do with the year in industry, and how much support they give you.”</p>
      <p>The quartet touched down in the States in August 2018, emerging into the Californian sunshine and a very different lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Their shared apartments, courtesy of Cisco, included access to a gym, pool and Jacuzzi.</p>
      <p>The Cisco complex, known as the campus, was equally well appointed.</p>
      <p>James says: “When you’re on campus, it’s a stereotypical Silicon Valley thing where you really could live there. There are showers provided, breakfast, lunch and even dinner sometimes. That’s Silicon Valley life.”</p>
